# Tagging Standard Format

## Executive Summary

This proposal suggests adopting a hierarchical, domain-driven tagging standard in the format `{domain}.{tag}={value}`. This approach reduces tag collisions, enhances governance and security, and allows domain experts to manage tags specific to their areas of responsibility. Implementing this standard will improve resource tracking, cost allocation, and overall cloud resource management.

## Overview

As cloud environments grow in complexity, the need for a structured approach to identify and manage cloud resources becomes critical. Tagging, the practice of assigning metadata to cloud resources, provides a flexible and scalable way to categorize and manage these assets. A standardized tagging approach aids in resource tracking, cost allocation, security, compliance, and automation. This Decision Preparation Document (DPD) outlines proposals for establishing a tagging standard format.

## Impact

Implementing a standardized tagging format will affect resource management, cost allocation, security policies, compliance measures, and automation processes across the organization. It will enhance visibility, enable better governance, and facilitate more efficient tracking and management of cloud resources.

## Key Considerations

- Management and organization of cloud resources
- Tagging structure and requirements
- Implementation strategies for the standard
- Governance and enforcement of the standard
- Limitations and constraints in different cloud environments
- Integration with existing systems and processes

## Stakeholders

| Stakeholder         | Role/Department            |
| ------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Cloud Platform Team | Cloud Infrastructure       |
| Security Team       | Security and Compliance    |
| Operations Team     | IT Operations              |
| Application Teams   | Development and Deployment |

## Background Information

Inconsistent tagging across cloud resources has led to challenges in resource tracking, cost allocation, security compliance, and automation. Existing tags are not applied uniformly, and there is a lack of governance around the tagging process. A standardized tagging approach is necessary to address these issues and improve overall cloud resource management.

## Proposal: Hierarchical Domain-Driven Tagging Standard

### Description

The proposed standard adopts a hierarchical structure, ensuring clarity and consistency across all tags. Tags follow the pattern: `{domain}.{tag}={value}`. This format allows specific domains or specialized groups to define tags necessary for their particular specialty. By using domain prefixes, we reduce the chance of tag collisions and enable domain experts to manage their tags effectively.

This approach:

- **Reduces Tag Collisions**: Allows different teams to use the same tag names without conflict because they are under different domains.
- **Enhances Governance and Security**: Enables setting security policies to restrict who can update certain tags. Tags used for automation control can be treated as security controls, and domain prefixes with wildcards can be used in policies to cover all tags within those domains.
- **Promotes Domain Expertise**: Domain experts manage their respective tags, ensuring that tags are relevant and accurately applied.
- **Provides Flexibility**: While this DPD does not decide if tags should be used for automation control, the tagging standard allows for it if decided in the future.

### Example Tags Using This Format

# Tagging for Automation Control

## Overview

This Decision Preparation Document (DPD) proposes the use of tags for automated operations in our cloud and datacenter (potentially) environments. By leveraging tags to control automation processes, we can enhance resource management, compliance, and operational efficiency.

## Impact

Implementing tags for automation control will affect resource lifecycle management, compliance adherence, operational workflows, and security policies. It will enable automated operations such as backups, data lifecycle management, and resource cleanup, ensuring that resources are managed according to their specified properties.

## Key Considerations

- Ensuring the accuracy and integrity of tags used for automation.
  - well-architected reviews to validate tag appropriateness.
- Integration of tagging standards with governance controls.

## Stakeholders

| Stakeholder         | Role/Department            |
| ------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Cloud Platform Team | Cloud Infrastructure       |
| Security Team       | Security and Compliance    |
| Operations Team     | IT Operations              |
| Application Teams   | Development and Deployment |

## Background Information

Using tags for automation control allows for dynamic and policy-driven management of resources. For example, tags can specify whether data is ephemeral or persistent, contains Personally Identifiable Information (PII), or requires specific compliance measures. Automation tools can then perform actions such as automatic backups, data lifecycle management, and resource cleanup based on these tags.

This DPD will use data lifecylcle management as an example. To be clear, this is just an example that helps to explain this concept and the use for data lifecylce management is not part of this proposal. A DPD would need to be executed for each specific use. This DPD is meant to serve as the decision for the generalized acceptance and enablement of this concept into reference architecture.

For instance, ephemeral data resources tagged appropriately can be automatically deleted after a certain period, while persistent data can be scheduled for regular backups and archived according to compliance requirements. This ensures efficient resource management and adherence to data retention policies.

However, ensuring the correctness of tags is critical. Incorrect tagging could lead to unintended data loss, compliance violations, or security risks. Therefore, governance mechanisms must be in place to control who can create or modify certain tags. This may involve restricting tagging permissions through policies or permission boundaries, and integrating tag validation into the development lifecycle, such as during the Permit to Operate procedure.

## Proposal

### Proposal 1: Implement Tags for Automation Control with Governance Measures

- **Description**: Implement a system where specific tags are required on certain resource types to control automated operations. These tags describe the nature of the resource (e.g., data classification, lifecycle requirements) and are enforced through policy as code. Automation services utilize these tags to perform actions like backups, archiving, and cleanup. Tag accuracy is ensured through governance measures, including permission restrictions and reviews during the development process.

- **Pros**:

  - **Improved Compliance and Governance**: Resources are managed according to their compliance requirements and organizational policies.
  - **Operational Efficiency**: Automation reduces manual workload and streamlines operations.
  - **Cost Optimization**: Automated cleanup of unused resources reduces unnecessary costs.
  - **Enhanced Security**: Controlled tagging mitigates risks associated with incorrect tag settings.
  - **Reduced Toil**: Simply tagging a resource appropriately can now take the place of one-off automation workflows or period manual operations for the given concern.

- **Cons**:
  - **Dependency on Accurate Tagging**: Errors in tagging can lead to serious issues such as data loss or compliance breaches.
  - **Additional Overhead**: Implementing governance measures will add additional time. However, this feature would not be a requirement to an MVP platform and can be added in later interations of the platform.

# Tagging Review Requirements

## Overview

This Decision Preparation Document (DPD) proposes integrating a well-architected review into the software development lifecycle (SDLC) to ensure the correctness and completeness of tags on resources before deployment to production and periodically thereafter. Accurate tagging is essential for resource management, compliance, and automation processes, especially when tags are used to control automated operations.

## Impact

Implementing tagging reviews within the SDLC will enhance the accuracy of resource tagging, thereby improving automation reliability, compliance adherence, and resource management, inventory and reporting.

## Key Considerations

- Establishing a mechanism for periodic re-evaluation of tags.
- Integration with existing Permit to Operate procedures.

## Stakeholders

| Stakeholder | Role/Department |
| ----------- | --------------- |
|             |                 |

## Proposal

### Proposal 1: Integrate Tagging Reviews into the Software Development Lifecycle

- **Description**: Implement a mandatory tagging review conducted by subject matter experts (SMEs) as part of the SDLC, prior to the initial production release and at regular intervals thereafter. This review ensures that all required tags are present and their values are accurate. The process can be integrated into existing procedures like the Permit to Operate, minimizing disruption to current workflows.

- **Pros**:

  - **Improved Tag Accuracy**: Ensures that resource tags are correct and meaningful.
  - **Enhanced Compliance**: Reduces risk of compliance violations due to misclassified resources.
  - **Better Automation Reliability**: Accurate tags enhance the effectiveness of automation processes.
  - **Cross-Team Collaboration**: Encourages communication between application teams and SMEs.

- **Cons**:
  - **Extended Development Timelines**: Adds an additional step that may lengthen the SDLC.
  - **Resource Allocation**: Requires availability of SMEs for reviews.
  - **Potential Bottlenecks**: Reviews could become a bottleneck if not managed efficiently.
  - **Training Needs**: Team members may require training on tagging standards and review processes.
